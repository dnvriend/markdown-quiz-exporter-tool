What is the formula for the circumference of a circle with radius $r$?

- ( ) $C = \pi r$
- (X) $C = 2\pi r$
- ( ) $C = \pi r^2$
- ( ) $C = 2\pi r^2$

# reason
The circumference is the distance around a circle. It equals the diameter ($2r$) multiplied by $\pi$:
$$C = 2\pi r$$

What is the area of a circle with radius $r$?

- ( ) $A = 2\pi r$
- ( ) $A = \pi r$
- (X) $A = \pi r^2$
- ( ) $A = 2\pi r^2$

# reason
The area of a circle is:
$$A = \pi r^2$$

For example, a circle with $r = 3$ has area $A = \pi \cdot 9 = 9\pi \approx 28.27$ square units.

In a right triangle, if $\theta$ is an angle, what does $\sin(\theta)$ equal?

- ( ) $\frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$
- (X) $\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$
- ( ) $\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$
- ( ) $\frac{\text{hypotenuse}}{\text{opposite}}$

# reason
The sine function is defined as:
$$\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$$

Remember SOH-CAH-TOA:
- **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse
- **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse
- **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent

---

What is the value of $\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta)$?

- ( ) $0$
- (X) $1$
- ( ) $2$
- ( ) $\tan(\theta)$

# reason
This is the **Pythagorean identity**, one of the fundamental trigonometric identities:
$$\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$$

This follows from the Pythagorean theorem applied to a unit circle.

---

What is $\tan(\theta)$ expressed in terms of sine and cosine?

- ( ) $\frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)}$
- (X) $\frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$
- ( ) $\sin(\theta) \cdot \cos(\theta)$
- ( ) $\sin(\theta) + \cos(\theta)$

# reason
The tangent is the ratio of sine to cosine:
$$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$$

---

What is the derivative of $f(x) = x^3$?

- ( ) $f'(x) = x^2$
- (X) $f'(x) = 3x^2$
- ( ) $f'(x) = 3x^3$
- ( ) $f'(x) = x^4$

# reason
Using the power rule $\frac{d}{dx}x^n = nx^{n-1}$:
$$\frac{d}{dx}x^3 = 3x^{3-1} = 3x^2$$

---

What is $\int x^2 \, dx$?

- (X) $\frac{x^3}{3} + C$
- ( ) $2x + C$
- ( ) $x^3 + C$
- ( ) $\frac{x^2}{2} + C$

# reason
The power rule for integration states $\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$:
$$\int x^2 \, dx = \frac{x^{2+1}}{2+1} + C = \frac{x^3}{3} + C$$

---

Evaluate the definite integral $\int_0^2 x \, dx$.

- ( ) $1$
- (X) $2$
- ( ) $4$
- ( ) $0$

# reason
First find the antiderivative, then apply the limits:
$$\int_0^2 x \, dx = \left[\frac{x^2}{2}\right]_0^2 = \frac{2^2}{2} - \frac{0^2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} - 0 = 2$$

What is the formula for compound interest, where $P$ is principal, $r$ is annual rate, $n$ is compounding frequency, and $t$ is time in years?

- ( ) $A = P(1 + rt)$
- (X) $A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$
- ( ) $A = Pe^{rt}$
- ( ) $A = P + Prt$

# reason
The compound interest formula is:
$$A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$$

Where:
- $A$ = final amount
- $P$ = principal (initial investment)
- $r$ = annual interest rate (decimal)
- $n$ = number of times compounded per year
- $t$ = time in years

---

What is the Present Value (PV) formula for a future cash flow $FV$ discounted at rate $r$ over $n$ periods?

- ( ) $PV = FV \times (1 + r)^n$
- (X) $PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n}$
- ( ) $PV = FV \times r \times n$
- ( ) $PV = FV - (r \times n)$

# reason
The present value discounts future money back to today:
$$PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n}$$

This reflects the **time value of money**: €100 today is worth more than €100 in the future.

---

The Net Present Value (NPV) formula is $NPV = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t}$. If initial investment is €1000 and you receive €600 in year 1 and €600 in year 2 at $r = 10\%$, what is the NPV?

- ( ) €-100
- (X) €41.32
- ( ) €200
- ( ) €1200

# reason
Calculate each term:
$$\begin{aligned}
NPV &= \frac{-1000}{(1.1)^0} + \frac{600}{(1.1)^1} + \frac{600}{(1.1)^2} \\
&= -1000 + 545.45 + 495.87 \\
&= 41.32
\end{aligned}$$

Since $NPV > 0$, this is a profitable investment.

What is the formula for Return on Investment (ROI)?

- ( ) $ROI = \frac{\text{Revenue}}{\text{Cost}} \times 100\%$
- (X) $ROI = \frac{\text{Gain} - \text{Cost}}{\text{Cost}} \times 100\%$
- ( ) $ROI = \frac{\text{Cost}}{\text{Gain}} \times 100\%$
- ( ) $ROI = \text{Gain} - \text{Cost}$

# reason
ROI measures the return relative to the investment cost:
$$ROI = \frac{\text{Gain} - \text{Cost}}{\text{Cost}} \times 100\%$$

Or equivalently: $ROI = \frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Cost}} \times 100\%$

The price elasticity of demand $E_d$ measures how quantity demanded responds to price changes. What is the formula?

- ( ) $E_d = \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q}$
- (X) $E_d = \frac{\%\Delta Q_d}{\%\Delta P}$
- ( ) $E_d = \frac{P}{Q}$
- ( ) $E_d = Q \times P$

# reason
Price elasticity of demand is:
$$E_d = \frac{\%\Delta Q_d}{\%\Delta P} = \frac{\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}}{\frac{\Delta P}{P}}$$

- If $|E_d| > 1$: **elastic** demand (sensitive to price)
- If $|E_d| < 1$: **inelastic** demand (insensitive to price)
- If $|E_d| = 1$: **unit elastic**

---

In economics, the profit maximization condition for a firm is:

- (X) $MR = MC$
- ( ) $MR > MC$
- ( ) $TR = TC$
- ( ) $AR = AC$

# reason
A firm maximizes profit where **Marginal Revenue equals Marginal Cost**:
$$MR = MC$$

At this point:
- If $MR > MC$: producing more increases profit
- If $MR < MC$: producing less increases profit
- If $MR = MC$: profit is maximized

---

The Break-Even Point (BEP) in units is calculated as:

- ( ) $BEP = \frac{FC}{P}$
- (X) $BEP = \frac{FC}{P - VC}$
- ( ) $BEP = \frac{VC}{P - FC}$
- ( ) $BEP = FC + VC$

# reason
The break-even point is where total revenue equals total cost:
$$BEP = \frac{FC}{P - VC}$$

Where:
- $FC$ = Fixed Costs
- $P$ = Price per unit
- $VC$ = Variable Cost per unit
- $P - VC$ = **Contribution Margin** per unit

---

What is the quadratic formula to solve $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$?

- ( ) $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 + 4ac}}{2a}$
- (X) $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
- ( ) $x = \frac{b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
- ( ) $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b - 4ac}}{a}$

# reason
The quadratic formula is:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

The **discriminant** $D = b^2 - 4ac$ determines the nature of solutions:
- $D > 0$: two real solutions
- $D = 0$: one real solution
- $D < 0$: no real solutions (complex roots)

---

What is the derivative of $e^x$?

- ( ) $xe^{x-1}$
- (X) $e^x$
- ( ) $\ln(x)$
- ( ) $e^{x-1}$

# reason
The exponential function $e^x$ is its own derivative:
$$\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x$$

This is one of the special properties of the number $e \approx 2.71828$.

---

What is $\int e^x \, dx$?

- ( ) $xe^x + C$
- (X) $e^x + C$
- ( ) $\frac{e^x}{x} + C$
- ( ) $e^{x+1} + C$

# reason
Since the derivative of $e^x$ is $e^x$, the integral is:
$$\int e^x \, dx = e^x + C$$

---

In CAPM, the formula is $E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i(E(R_m) - R_f)$. What does $\beta_i$ represent?

- ( ) The risk-free rate
- ( ) The market return
- (X) The systematic risk of asset $i$ relative to the market
- ( ) The total return of asset $i$

# reason
In the **CAPM** (Capital Asset Pricing Model) formula:
- $R_f$ = risk-free rate
- $E(R_m)$ = expected market return
- $\beta_i$ = beta coefficient, measuring **systematic (market) risk**

A $\beta = 1$ means the asset moves with the market. $\beta > 1$ means more volatile than market.

The GDP (Gross Domestic Product) expenditure formula is:

- (X) $GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)$
- ( ) $GDP = C + I + G + X + M$
- ( ) $GDP = C - I + G + X$
- ( ) $GDP = C + I - G + M$

# reason
GDP by expenditure approach:
$$GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)$$

Where:
- $C$ = Consumer spending
- $I$ = Investment
- $G$ = Government spending
- $X$ = Exports
- $M$ = Imports
- $(X - M)$ = **Net exports**
